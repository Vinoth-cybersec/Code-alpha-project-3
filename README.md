# RFIDBlocking
Block RFID scanners from reading your cards

This code should be able to run on a Raspberry Pi and block RFID scanners from reading your cards by turning on the blocking signal for a specified duration.

you can connect the RFID reader to the Raspberry Pi and run the code. 
The code will turn on the blocking signal for 5 seconds, which will make it more difficult for RFID scanners to interpret the data on the RFID tag or card.

To Run this you will need:
1. A Raspberry Pi with an operating system installed, such as Raspbian.
2. An RFID reader that is capable of capturing and transmitting the RFID signal to the Raspberry Pi.
3. The RFID tag or card that you want to protect.
4. A connection between the RFID reader and the Raspberry Pi, such as a USB cable or Bluetooth connection.
